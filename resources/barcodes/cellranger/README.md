# Barcode whitelists

Each 10x barcode whitelist is the list of all known barcode sequences that have been
included in the assay kit and are available during library preparation. The barcode
whitelists in this directory are obtained from the 10x CellRanger software bundle and
provided here for convenience.

The table below shows which list in the barcodes folder is relevant to which chemistry:

| Name of barcodes list   | Chemistry                                    |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 3M-febrary-2018.txt.gz  | Single Cell 3' v3                            |
| 737k-august-2016.txt    | Single Cell 3' v2 & Single Cell 5' v1 and v2 |
| 737k-april-2014_rc.txt  | Single Cell 3' v1                            |
| 737k-arc-v1.txt.gz      | Single Cell Multiome (ATAC+GEX) v1           |
| 9K-LT-march-2021.txt.gz | Single Cell 3' LT                            |
